# WakFarm
Open source farming bot for Wakfu

Hey guys, 
HoPollo here, I'm a beginner in AutoIt & programming in general,
and like to mess around with games I play to make a fun way to learn programming.

Today i'm sharing a quick project with you guys. 
The goal is not to blindly download, use & complain about it ! 
But to improves it together, in any case you will have to adjust settings/images for your own !

So, let me know about all your suggestions or more & let's make that super smart step by step.
