Open source farming bot for Wakfu

Hey guys, 
HoPollo here, I'm a beginner in AutoIt & programming in general,
and like to mess around with games I play to make a fun way to learn programming.

Today i'm sharing a quick project with you guys. 
The goal is not to blindly download, use & complain about it ! 
But to improves it together, in any case you will have to adjust settings/images for your own !

So, let me know about all your suggestions or more & let's make that super smart step by step.

## IMPORTANT : 
In order to compile this program you may have to download Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package
[x86](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328) // [x64](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13523)
