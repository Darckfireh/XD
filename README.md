# Wakfarm
Open source farming bot for Wakfu

Hey guys, 
HoPollo here, I'm a beginner in AutoIt & programming in general,
and like to mess around with games I play to make a fun way to learn programming.

Today i'm sharing a quick project with you guys. 
The goal is not to blindly download, use & complain about it ! 
But to improves it together, in any case you will have to adjust settings/images for your own !

So, let me know about all your suggestions or more & let's make that super smart step by step.

## How to build it ?

1°) : Download the latest version of AutoIt. (https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/)  
2°) : Download this GitHub folder.  
3°) : Tweak the script with your pixels/screen size if needed.  
4°) : Edit the "target.png" to the creature you want to farm.  
5°) : Run/Build the script and Enjoy.
